Thanks for dropping by my personal website. I am Pratyush Sinha, tinkerer and general wise guy. I live in Bangalore and work as a computer vision algorithm developer. I am currently consulting with a small video analytics company called [AllGoVision](http://www.allgovision.com/). In a previous life, I used to do product management for the good folks at [Hike messenger](https://hike.in/). 

I want to use technology to help tackle hard social problems and also earn loads of money doing so. My professional interests lie in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, leaning heavily on the former at the moment. 

One of my recurring ambitions is to create a telepathic communication system. I hope to commit more earnestly to it someday.

I enjoy football, science, mathematics, science fiction, and well written comedies ([Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienp4J3pW7U), [Yes Minister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvYuoWyk8iU), [Seinfeld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ397q6JjAQ), [The Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPu_d4SSOPk) etc). I like to travel whenever I can. You may like to read about that one time I [cycled alone close to 300 km in 3 days](https://medium.com/@hsuytarp/bangalore-to-coorg-806ec9dcff3e). I also run a speculative fiction website [Omelette du Fromage](https://omelettedufromage.xyz/). I have other interests in life that keep meandering very frequently.  

My social and political views have changed a lot over time. Right now, they would lie somewhere close to [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism). However, my views are still evolving and I do not guarantee to stick to them. New information arises out of unpredictability and it would be really sad if everything you had to say could be easily guessed based on a label you choose to ascribe yourself.



<!-- Prior to that I studied (very little) electrical engineering at [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).

I was born in the ancient city of [Pataliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra) (modern-day [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna)). I partly grew up there and partly in various cities across Gujarat ([Morbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbi), [Surat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat), [Bharuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharuch), [Vadodara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara), [Anand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand,_Gujarat)). -->
