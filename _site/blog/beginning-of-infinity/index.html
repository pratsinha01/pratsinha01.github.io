        <p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br />
On the importance of explanations. Definitely worth a read. Very interesting thought experiments. Extremely expansive in its scope - quantum physics, black holes, politics, morality, beauty et al.<br />
Main takeaway - ‘Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble’<br />
My learnings follow.</p>

<h4 id="for-the-more-patient-among-you">For the more patient among you</h4>

<p>I recently finished reading the book ‘The Beginning of Infinity’ by the Oxford physicist David Deutsch. It took me quite a while to do so. This was not only because of the size of the book (~500 pages) but also because of the density and novelty of insights.</p>

<p>The central theme of the book is the reach of knowledge and the central role that explanations have in its creation.</p>

<p>Human knowledge grows by a process of <strong>conjecture and criticism</strong> in a process similar to biological evolution - conjecture as <strong>variation</strong> and criticism as <strong>selection</strong>.</p>

<p>The best current theories will likely have a finite reach and fail at some point. We need to admit it and keep correcting our errors. Knowledge creation is essentially a process of <strong>error correction</strong>. It can go on infinitely. This is one of the senses of the word infinity in the title.</p>

<p>Knowledge creating systems like humans or genes have a <strong>special property</strong>. They can affect changes in the physical universe at great distances and in profound manners without the intervening space being modified in any significant way.<br />
For example - humans can send robots to Mars to dig a tunnel.
This is another sense in which infinity is used since the reach of knowledge is potentially infinite.</p>

<p>Humans as <strong>universal constructors</strong>. Given sufficient knoweldge and wealth, a knowledge creating system can transform a physical system into any other physical system that is allowed by the laws of physics. This is yet another meaning of infinity.</p>

<p>Explanations can appear at various <strong>levels of abstractions</strong> known as <strong>emergence</strong>. They can also appear at various levels of approximation. When you heat a bowl of water, you could say that bubbles form because the ‘temperature’ reaches a certain ‘boiling point’. This is a useful explanation. A more lower level one would be that the kinetic energy of the particles increases. However, getting from this theory to predicting the formation of bubbles is non-trivial. There is no reason for one particular level of abstraction to be more fundamental or important than another. The various levels of explanations is yet another sense of infinity.</p>

<p>There are more such interpretations of infinity that are peppered throughout the book and that relate directly to the role of knowledge.</p>

<p><em>Optimism</em><br />
Does not mean nothing bad will happen. That is pessimism in disguise. 
It means that the <strong>root of problems is insufficient knowledge and wealth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble.</strong></p>

<p><em>Bad philosophy and bad science</em><br />
People often try to answer moral and philosophical questions using ‘science’. For example, the morality of killing animals. This is justified using biological ‘evidence’ to demonstrate that animals feel ‘pain’. However, pain like the sensation of seeing a colour is a <strong>quale</strong> (plural - qualia). Qualia are not something we don’t much understand scientifically yet. So in this case, society is just delegating a tough moral conversation about animals to bad science.
There is more discussion around Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics that I will have to read more to get my head around.</p>

<p>Empiricism, Inductivism, Justificationism, Logical positivism, linguistic philosophy, Wittgenstein, post-modernism are contradicted unfavourably with <strong>fallibilism</strong>. I need to read <strong>Popper</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Society</em><br />
Society is organised such that a few people are delegated the task of taking decisions that affect everyone. 
Every individual is a possible policy maker. Some people volunteer for the task of doing so. The rest of the society should think of them as explanations. <strong>Competing political entities are akin to competing conjectures or explanations</strong>. We test one of them out for a tenure. Then if it seems not to work, we get rid of them by voting them out.
The true value of a democratic system is not in that it ‘represents’ people’s views. It is in that it provides a system where <strong>bad policies can be rejected peacefully</strong> while maintaining stability. Often in the past bad leadership was either disposed off in revolutions or lost out in battles.
‘Representing’ the choice of the society of even an individual is a logical impossibility. (Read social choice theory)</p>

<p><em>Art and beauty</em><br />
Nature of beauty may not always be objective but a lot of times is. For example, flowers appear beautiful due to their need for unique cross-species signalling towards insects. This was honestly the least convincing section of the book but interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Static and Dynamic societies</em><br />
The enlightenment that the West first encountered and which the rest of the world is now going through at different rates is giving rise to dynamic societies. These are societies where the use of <strong>innovation or creativity is directed towards challenging existing explanations</strong>.
Contrast this with static societies, which is most of the societies in the past where adhering to existing memes was highly valued and deviation looked down upon. So human creativity was directed towards best keeping the memes intact as they were.</p>

<p><em>Sustainability</em><br />
The idea that sustainability means we should stop using up natural resource and keep things as they are is wrong. This is so because this would mean we are only waiting for a previously unencountered problem to come and destroy us. Sustainability means creating knowledge and wealth (resources) so that we can overcome ever newer challenges. To repeat - problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble.
For example -<br />
Climate change. The main focus of all discussions and treaties is to reduce the contribution of anthropogenic rise in temperature. The problem with this approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are not focussing on mitigating climate change. What should we do if sea-level rise happens anyway even without human contribution ?</li>
  <li>These decisions are based on economic models that don’t take into account future knowledge. They are no different from phropesies and are not ‘scientific’</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The title of the book</em><br />
Taken from a quote in Asimov’s ‘The End of Eternity’. Used in this book in the sense that if we are indeed on a path towards infinite knowledge creation then at any point of time, we are uniquely at the beginning of that infinity.</p>
