<p>I took an 8 month break from work beginning July 2016 till March 2017. This was after two years of working as an associate product manager at hike messenger.</p>

<p><a name="why"><strong>Why did I take the break ?</strong></a></p>

<p><em>Work hours</em><br />
My work hours at hike were usually long. I left around 9 in the morning and came back by 9 in the night or even later. It wasn’t that I had a lot of work. Sometimes I did but a lot of times work just expanded to take up the time I had. As a result I was left with very little time to do anything for myself. I was usually too tired on the weekends to do much but rest and maybe exercise.</p>

<p><em>Unnatural lifestyle</em><br />
Delhi can be unforgiving place weather-wise for most parts of the year. It’s either too hot or too cold. So most of my time was spent indoors in an air-conditioned environment. I’d sleep in an AC at home, travel in an AC cab and spend my day in an AC office. So one day while talking to a friend who was rejoicing at the rain and temporary respite from heat, the penny dropped for me. I had failed to notice the good weather because I had not seen the sun in weeks. This did not seem right to me.</p>

<p><em>Content of work</em><br />
While working at hike was at times quite interesting, I had begun to feel that I was only having an impact on a very small component of the overall business. 
I had joined in a product management role straight out of college without any hands on technical experience. So often during my work I felt my hands to be tied. I wanted to build things on my own but the best I could do was make some mockups of them and hope that others found the idea interesting enough to work on it.
Thirdly, even through college I had never really worked on a project end to end and that sense of unfulfilled potential did gnaw at me. I longed to create something with my hands and polish it.<br />
Now I could have stayed at hike and tried to fight for these. But I didn’t want to be constrained by any kind of institutional limitations.</p>

<p><em>Financial security</em><br />
Two years of job had meant I had decent enough saving even though I had not invested or spent money too wisely. It is amazing what a bit of money in the bank can do for your risk appetite.</p>

<p><a name="plan"><strong>What/How had I planned for it ?</strong></a></p>

<p>With the money I had saved, I figured that I could easily last for 2 years at a comfortable lifestyle and perhaps 3 years if I pinched a bit along with some travel thrown in.</p>

<p>So I did not have any immediate hard deadline not he break.</p>

<p>Things I had planned to do during this period included:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Backpacking</li>
  <li>Working on fitness</li>
  <li>Doing online courses on machine learning</li>
  <li>Improving my coding skills</li>
  <li>Dating girls</li>
  <li>Taking the GRE</li>
  <li>Applying for internship positions abroad in AI</li>
  <li>Reading as many books as I could and specifically Gödel Escher Bach</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Starting up</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="endup"><strong>What/How did it end up like ?</strong></a></p>

<p>Let’s review how my plans went regarding each of the 10 things I mentioned above.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Backpacking <br />
I travelled for around 25 days across the Western Ghats. The highlight of the period was my solo cycling trip from Bangalore to Coorg. I wrote more about it <a href="https://medium.com/@hsuytarp/bangalore-to-coorg-806ec9dcff3e">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Working on fitness <br />
This has been a failure. All my attempts fizzle out after the initial excitement.</li>
  <li>Doing online courses on machine learning <br />
This went well to an extent. I began with some of the more theoretical courses but soon realised that machine learning is moving more towards the hacker kind of DIY era. This dovetailed in with my plan to work on my coding skills. I feel that I need to work on my statistical skills. Will write more on learning machine learning separately.</li>
  <li>Improve coding skills<br />
 I did not work on this separately but as part of my plan to learn machine learning. I won’t say I am a good programmer. But I now have enough confidence to be able to hack something up with the help of stackoverflow and given enough time.</li>
  <li>Dating girls<br />
 This went surprisingly well. Thanks in no small part to technology (read Tinder). I went out with more girls than I would have ever done in life prior to this point (zero).</li>
  <li>Taking the GRE<br />
 The quantitative and language part went well. I screwed up the essays. I will take it again if needed but I do not have any immediate plans of going for higher studies.</li>
  <li>Applying for internship positions abroad in AI <br />
I figured I would do this if I needed to go for higher studies but I realised I did not want to do that. So I dropped this plan after a while</li>
  <li>Reading as many books as I could and especially Gödel Escher Bach<br />
 One can never really be satisfied with the number of books one reads. Even so, I feel that I did not read enough and instead wasted time surfing the internet or watching some stuff. GEB still resides on my shelf incompletely read.</li>
  <li>Writing <br />
I did not do enough of it. I am trying to make up for it now.</li>
  <li>Starting up <br />
I did not startup. I still have not figured out what problem to solve. I need to brainstorm more on this.</li>
</ol>

<p>There were a few things I did that I had not planned on.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Moving to Bangalore<br />
 This was as much to get away from home as to get away from the Delhi pollution. Plus I like the weather and the fact that it allows me to walk around throughout the year.</li>
  <li>Standup comedy<br />
 The standup comedy scene in Bangalore is very vibrant and I took up performing at open mics. I quit after about 6 months due to competing priorities and loss of interest. This experience of mine deserves a separate article.</li>
  <li>Learning the keyboard<br />
 I took classes for a month. Will take it up again soon.</li>
  <li>Applying for an internship at a computer vision company</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="learn"><strong>What did I learn ?</strong></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Doing and Learning</em></strong> </p>

<p>After a long time, I tried to get out of my comfort zone and do new things on my own. Below are some of the things I learnt during this process. Some of it may be obvious to people who have had a more hands-on upbringing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>When you try something new, chances are you’d be wrong or embarrassed. Don’t let that stop you from doing something</li>
  <li>There is hidden complexity even in things that look very trivial.</li>
  <li>Keep things as simple as possible but no more simple. This is a corollary to the previous point. Things will get complex as you go along. It’s important to keep that in check so that you have a handle. <br />
Example - When you pack for a long trip, you should keep the bare minimum number of clothes. Stuff piles on very quickly. I faced this during my trip. My backpack became too heavy and my agility was effected. At places I had to leave my bag behind in my hotel room, which is not always a good decision.</li>
  <li>Doing is the best way of learning if you ultimately want to do the said thing. This is because it is impossible to explicitly state every step like a recipe (because of the above mentioned complexity). Doing also helps you understand the problem you are trying to solve much more intimately. This is not to belittle theory. But one should start doing as soon as one has the understanding of the minimum possible theory. Theory should be used as a guide to doing rather than an end in itself. <br />
Example -
    <ul>
      <li>Say you want to learn to recognise the digits in an image. One way is to study all possible courses on machine learning and then when you think you are confident enough, attempt the problem. The other option is to look for the easiest approach, code it up and see what results you get. Then read up on why it’s not the best trick. Find better approaches that people have tried. Decide on one of them and attempt it. Tweak it to suit your problem. And so on.</li>
      <li>Say you are a standup comedian and you have thought of some great new idea. The best way to judge it is to tell it to people and notice their reaction. This is actually a pretty standard practice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Iterative<br />
 Progress almost always happens iteratively. Don’t aim for perfection unless the cost is too high such as while landing a plane (in which case you shouldn’t have tried it in the first place).</li>
  <li>Patience <br />
Getting results or developing proficiency takes time even if you think you are doing everything right. Being patient is the single most important thing in such a case. And also the toughest for me personally. This realisation has helped me a lot</li>
  <li>Perseverance<br />
 The other reason for giving up is usually when you are stuck or if you keep getting wrong or unsatisfactory results. This should be treated as part of the learning process.</li>
  <li>Doing different things helps you make new mental connections. You start seeing how problems in very different domains are the manifestation of some more general process.<br />
Example -  The process of iterative improvement mentioned above works in programming, standup comedy, writing, learning to play a song, coming up with a business model and a lot of other things. What varies is how you can best define an iteration, measure its output and determine the change that has to be made.</li>
  <li>Different things are different. This is a corollary to the previous point. While you can draw similarities between different pursuits, you also appreciate the specialised skill required in each task individually. Points 8 and 9 have made me appreciate people who are decently proficient in multiple skills in addition to their main one.</li>
  <li>Enjoying the process<br />
 You could keep at a task if the end goal is something that has deep value for you, which is often called passion. Finding such an end goal is rare. A better indicator of what you must do in life is whether you enjoy the day to day process of doing that thing. This requires experimentation before you can zero in on any one thing. Or you may continue doing multiple things and that is fine.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>General life gyaan</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s better to take chances than not. Especially when the downside is non-fatal. All good things come from taking risks. 
I landed my current job through a mail that I had been really hesitant to send. However, once I did overcome my second guessing, the whole process got over in a matter of one working day.</li>
  <li>Financial security helps. While money is not the most important thing in the world, having savings does unconstrain you from what you can and cannot do. <br />
The best thing you can do for yourself is find a source of passive income early in life.</li>
  <li>Getting out of an institutional mindset. I have mentioned above how I first planned on and then rejected the idea of going for a masters. After comparing my time in college and then outside it, I realised that most of what makes me happy today was learned in the latter phase. The one big advantage of going to college is being around smart, energetic people. I am trying to make up for that through Twitter and attending meetups. Obviously, not a like for like replacement. But it also means I am unconstrained by school curriculum, demands of professors, and student loans. So I am prepared for a life of autodidacts at least for the next few years.</li>
  <li>The temptation to give in to passive consumption is real and very strong. Be it the passive consumption of information through Facebook, Twitter and the lot or of entertainment through the sundry streaming services or of food via delivery apps. I need to be forever vigilante against it as it affects my decision making in insidious ways that I know I’ll regret later.</li>
  <li>All the points above have a common theme and that is individual freedom. I have realised that freedom is the most important thing for me. It has also begun to inform my political views and life decisions in a major way.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="different"><strong>What could have I done differently ?</strong></a></p>

<ol>
  <li>Been more thrifty with money <br />
I did not cut down on my lifestyle even without a job. While I still had some savings, this prompted me to take up a job faster than I would have liked to</li>
  <li>Avoid Passive consumption<br />
 I spent considerable time neither doing anything productive nor completely chilling out. Often on my trip I would find myself scrolling through a Facebook feed. This is something I won’t like to happen again.</li>
  <li>Exercise<br />
 As already mentioned this was a failure. I have realised that I cannot exercise in a controlled environment like a gym. Instead, I would prefer playing a sport or doing manual labour to some end. Once I get over my injury, I will work on this.</li>
  <li>Be more social<br />
 Oftentimes, I go into anti-social phases when I keep to myself and don’t talk to people. These can last for weeks at end. If I go to a new place in the midst of such a phase, I may not get along with the people ever. This sort of happened to me a lot of times during the break.</li>
  <li>Started up<br />
 I did not startup. I really wanted to but I did not. I could not find a problem worth solving with a solution that I thought had novelty. This is obviously not the end of the road and I will get back to it again in the future.</li>
  <li>Be more focussed in doing what I was doing<br />
 This follows from point 2. Passive consumption can lead to a kind of anxiety and indecision about what you want to do. Or rather passive consumption can help you fill in for the anxiety that comes with making decisions about what you want to do. Need to keep working on this without lapse.</li>
  <li>Travel more - backpack in the true sense<br />
 Apart from the Western Ghats trip, I only made a couple of short trips during this time. I should have allocated time better to this. Again, something I’ll work on.</li>
  <li>Invested in cryptocurrencies earlier <br />
Haha. Everyday I wasted thinking about this and not doing was money wasted. Please go and invest.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="again"><strong>Will I do it again ?</strong></a><br />
Yes!<br />
I have decided to take a break every 2 or 3 years. This should help in assessing my life and career periodically. This should also help in trying new things and changing career tracks.</p>
