India's external affairs minister recently gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) lambasting Pakistan. She termed the state 'Terroristan' and also extolled how India had devevloped institutes of excellence and become an IT superpower.

A lot of people I know or have observed on social media hailed the speech. I understand that these points were supposed to be rhetorical, meant to highlight the different paths the two countries have taken. What I do not get is why are people congratulating themselves for the achievements listed.

Sometimes a comparison can be useful as in the case of what are the approaches being taken to reduce malnutrition and how can we do better.

However, comparisons do not help when we have to measure progress. Saying our GDP grew by so much while yours did not is useless. Saying we have got metro rails while you still use buses is useless. Saying we have got big-ish tech companies while you don't is useless.

Pakistan's economy is one-sixth ours. It does not clamour for membership to the UNSC or to become a superpower. We do. However, getting to our goal is tough and we don't often progress at the rate we wish to. In such cases, it becomes tempting to compare ouselves to people who are worse off and feel better about ourselves. This is a dangerous tendency and indulging in it belies a lack of confidence in our ability to fulfill our ambitions.

If anything in India has to compared to Pakistan, it is the state of UP. The two entities have almost identical population.
Has UP really created more institutions of excellence than Pakistan in the last 70 years ? How about multi-national companies ? And how about infant mortality, per capita income and other such standard human development measures ?

This comparison won't go down as well as the one Sushma ji presented.

So should UP aspire to become Pakistan ?

Not all. It should rather compare itself in the short term to a benchmark like Indonesia, which has a per capita GDP that is 3-4 times that of UP.

Yet another tendency I have noticed is residents of Indian states comparing themselves to each other and demeaning others. I find this a pointless exercise. Even with the relative disparity among states, all of us are far far away from where we want to be. 

People from the rest of this part of the world are us, however poorly they may be doing at this point of time. We should aspire to be higher.

So Andhra Pradesh should compare itself to South Korea, Maharasthra to Germany, Delhi to the Netherlands and so on. The nation as a whole should get away from the Pakistan fixation and compare itself to China or the US. 

Only when you set your sights higher would you work hard or smart enough to reach there.
