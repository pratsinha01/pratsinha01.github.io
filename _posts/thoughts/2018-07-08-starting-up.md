I started up recently. Or more precisely, I joined a startup my friend had been working on for a while and which I had been helping out with for a few months. You can check us out here.

Entrepreneurs are society's heroes. They take risks on behalf of everyone else and move the world forward. 

We have only just begun. I hope we can go further enough to be able to call ourselves entrepreneurs. The first aim is to make a token amount (of say INR 100,000) just so that we know that we are capable of making money. We will then take things ahead as they come.

Starting up means I will have to make some sacrifices. I'll be short on cash for the foreseeable future and I won't have much time to go on vacations or to just chill. I might not even take a day off for stretches of time. I might also not have the time to go out on dates as I used to. Then there is always the chance that the company might fail and I would end up with little to show for the time and effor that I put in.

These are some of the things I am aware of. I have taken a decision keeping them in mind and I will need to live with the consequences. I am fine with that.

I hope to stay positive and focussed on the company. I will try to make the most of the little free time that I do get. It might even turn out to be a blessing in disguise as I might start appreciating leisure and friendships more.

Let us see where things go. I'll keep updating here.
