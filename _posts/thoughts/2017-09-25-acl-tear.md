I tore my anterior cruciate ligament last to last Friday (15 September) while playing football. I also had a minor fracture and sprains in some of the other ligaments.

What this means is that I will have to undergo a surgery to reconstruct the ligament. This will be followed by a period of pain and rehabilitation lasting potentially upto a year. 

While I was lying on the stretcher at the hospital, waiting to get my X-ray done, there was a moment where I tried asking myself why did it have to happen to me. Had I decided not to play that night, I might have been healthily moving about. 

I am really happy that it was only a brief moment and such thoughts have not entered my mind again. What has happened cannot be changed. You can only learn from it. What you need to do is figure out what to do next.

Talking of silver linings, I am in a way relieved because of the injury. I have hurt my knees plenty of times in the past but have got away without any formal treatment. This gives me an opportunity to start over and work on my knee properly.

As of this moment, I am looking forward to have the surgery done. I will go through my physiotherapy with intent (शिद्दत).

I hope to come out of this experience as a stronger person - both physically and mentally.
